<h1> About me</h1> 
<p>Welcome to my site! I hope it will help you learn more about my experience, interests and skills. I'm passionate about stories and how to tell them, whether it be for news, literature, movies, comic books and more.</p>
      
<p>I've worked in several kinds of positions, from a movie theater usher to a communications intern for South Florida's PBS station. Check out my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> to learn more. I've also been published in two Gainesville, Fla., media outlets. You can see my <a href="writing.html">writing</a> here.</p>
        
<p>I'm currently a journalism major at the University of Florida and plan to graduate in May 2014. I previously studied history and Arabic for two years at Florida State University, but transferred to UF to expand my media skills. I've taken a variety of courses on literature, history, religion, film, graphic design, photography and reporting. I'm also a huge nerd for comic books, film history and science fiction TV, which I write about on my <a href=http://rewindgirl.com>blog</a>.</p>
    
<p>As a Miami, Fla., native and Cuban-American feminist, I have great ardor for social issues and encouraging diversity. My multicultural background and studies have given me a perspective on the world that I hope brings something different to all my work and writing.</p>
